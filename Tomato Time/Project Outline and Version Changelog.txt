Objective: a customizable, fully functional application capable of not only counting down a user-configrable amount of time, but also playing a sound once the time has expired if the user so desires.

Versions:
 0.01: Functional Console App - Will count down from a user-entered amount of time (in seconds). Proof of concept more than anything, no extrenuous features planned.
